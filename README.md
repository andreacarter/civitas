## Civitas - Next Generation CRA Compliance Management

Civitas is a compliance management tool designed for banks to track their Community Reinvestment Act Initiatives. 

## Background 

Civitas is an application I created based off my experience overseeing bank initiatives as required by the Community Reinvestment Act, also known as CRA.
CRA is a US federal law that was designed to encourage banks to meet the needs of the communities they serve, particularly low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.
Banks of a certain size are subject to CRA examinations, in which they are assessed on their community lending, investment, and service activities and whether or not low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and populations are adequately served.
These assessments cover multiple years of data, so accurate documentation and tracking of these initiatives are key to a successful examination.
